- Kanban vs Scrum

  item | Scrum | Kanban  
  -----|-------|------  
  Cadence|Regular fixed length sprints(ie: 2weeks)| Continupus Flow
  Release methodolgy|At the end of each sprints of approved by the product owner|Countinuous delivery or at the team`s discretion|
  Roles|Product owner,Scrum master,development team|No existing roles.Some teams enlist the help of an agile coach|
  key metrics|Veloctity|Cycle time|
  Change philosophy|Teams should stive to not make changes to the sprint forecast during the sprint.Doing so compromises learnings around estimation|Change can happen at any time|
